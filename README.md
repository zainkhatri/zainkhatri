## About Me

i’m zain. i graduated from uc san diego in cognitive science & machine learning. right now, i’m at nasa building tools that turn system diagrams into live simulations. basically helping engineers test how things might fail before they’re even built.

before that, i worked on real-time brainwave classification at uc berkeley, and built autonomous rovers, agent-based ai apps, and fast data systems.

outside of code, i'm usually hooping, learning new songs on the guitar, or playing chess.
